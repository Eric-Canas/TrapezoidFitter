**QuadrilateralFitter** helps you find that four corners polygon that **best approximates** your noisy data or detection, so you can apply further processing steps like: _perspective correction_ or _pattern matching_, without worrying about noise or non-expected vertex.

Optimal **Fitted Quadrilateral** is the smallest area quadrilateral that contains all the points inside a given polygon.
